# prism-inset
A redesign of WunWae's prism with common boxx style buttons. The controller button elevation is designed for *low profile switches*. Regular switches of course will fit, but the buttons will be higher from the surface.
I also didn't care about the looks of the controller, so there is no bottom case or proper place for electronics. I hot glued my pico in the controller and routed a gcc extension cable through the 4mm hole.

### Button Fitment
The stems of the buttons may need to be adjusted design wise depending on your printer. These were somewhat tight on my machine already. Tough, there are a couple slicer tricks that you can employ to get some better stems. I printed mine with a .3 nozzle at .3 width, but beforehand have also printed .3 width with a .4 nozzle.
I did a lot of testing a couple years back and was able to somewhat reliably print down to *.07 width with a .4 nozzle*. So, you should be able to get some proper buttons without any hardware mods.

I wasn't sure about how much tolerance to give around the buttons due to supported overhangs never being quite perfect, so there might be more room than you'd like. There was enough room for the buttons to have no issues without needing to sand supported surfaces.
